# Future directions

CHON presents new possibilities for musical expression, and I have only scratched the surface. I would like to extend the software to make it easier to use and more accessible so that other composers might make use of it. But I am still experimenting with the ways CHON can already generate sonic gestures in its current form.

In *Pand√¶monium*, I decided to align the notes to an eighth-note grid to make the music more feasible to play by the two performers. I think this diminishes the physical metaphor somewhat because it obscures the varying speed of the particles. However, removing the strictly quantized grid in a future piece will require some other solution for keeping performers in sync, such as a click-track. I also think it might be fruitful to explore mapping other parameters of the particles to a score. For example, the velocity of each particle averaged over a short time or the total potential energy of the system might be used to create interesting musical gestures.


I have also imagined musical works for live performer and CHON where the sound of the performer drives CHON in sympathetic resonance. This could lead to many performance network topologies such as a feedback loop where CHON generates control data which generates sound that drives CHON, or a duet where two performers drive CHON with the sound they generate. This will require further development and UI decisions to make sure it is simple and reliable to use.

CHON has been under continual development for more than a year and will likely continue to grow and improve. I plan to add several features in the near future. I want to add a preset function that allows the configuration of CHON to be saved and recalled at a later time. I also want to add more physical parameters to the OSC stream. As stated before, this could include velocity, potential energy, collisions, and other physical attributes of the particles. Other aspects of CHON will continue to be developed and refined to make CHON more user-friendly and flexible.

Another area that CHON could be extended is in the way the user can interact with it. The gestural basis of CHON's philosophy suggests that it would be well-suited to gestural control. CHON could benefit from gestural interfaces like the LeapMotion[@ultraleap_leap_nodate] or a simple webcam paired with a gesture recognition software such as Wekinator[@fiebrink_wekinator_nodate]. Admittedly, a mouse is not the most intuitive controller for CHON, but it is the most ubiquitous. Therefore, I chose to focus on mouse control for the first version of CHON, leaving the option open for other control methods in the future.

Finally, one of my active areas of research is to extend the classical mechanics already represented in my music into the realm of quantum mechanics. While classical mechanics fulfills the role of a universally intrinsic logic for my music to follow, quantum mechanics is far less intuitive to most people. However, my goal in using quantum mechanics in music not to rely on an established intuitive logic for my music. Rather, I aim to render intangible quantum interactions more tangible through sonification. Whereas through classical mechanics I aim to make my music tangible, I hope to make quantum mechanics tangible through my music. Thus, I plan to extend CHON or a version of CHON to represent "quantum harmonic oscillators". This will add a probabilistic element to the particles and their interactions.

In developing CHON and experimenting with it, I have already begun to realize my vision of energetic sonic objects pushing and pulling on one another, but I have only begun to explore the musical possibilities that CHON affords. The physics of coupled harmonic oscillators seems to have a wealth of potential in creating physically coupled sound events and transformations. I will continue to explore this new musical territory and to develop CHON, and I hope that making CHON open source and freely available will encourage others to do the same.
