# Appendix A: Timeline{.unnumbered}

What follows is a timeline of the most significant milestones I achieved while pursuing my Masters of Science in Media arts and Technology.

**Fall 2017**

- Took first course in MAT (240C – Karl Yerkes)
- Appointed CREATE Technical Coordinator

**Winter 2018**		

- Finished *PISCES* (Pisces Interactive Spectral Compression Engine & Synthesizer) as final project for 240B. This was my first software implementation of what I would come to call "spectral dilation" effects. (https://github.com/rodneydup/Pisces)
- Premiered *Quinto Suono* - a string quartet composed using an algorithm I created to generate difference tones.
