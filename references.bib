	abstract = {Apart from its natural relevance to cognition, music provides a window into the intimate relationships between production, perception, experience, and emotion. Here, emotional responses and neural activity were observed as they evolved together with stimulus parameters over several minutes. Participants listened to a skilled music performance that included the natural fluctuations in timing and sound intensity that musicians use to evoke emotional responses. A mechanical performance of the same piece served as a control. Before and after fMRI scanning, participants reported real-time emotional responses on a 2-dimensional rating scale (arousal and valence) as they listened to each performance. During fMRI scanning, participants listened without reporting emotional responses. Limbic and paralimbic brain areas responded to the expressive dynamics of human music performance, and both emotion and reward related activations during music listening were dependent upon musical training. Moreover, dynamic changes in timing predicted ratings of emotional arousal, as well as real-time changes in neural activity. BOLD signal changes correlated with expressive timing fluctuations in cortical and subcortical motor areas consistent with pulse perception, and in a network consistent with the human mirror neuron system. These findings show that expressive music performance evokes emotion and reward related neural activations, and that music’s affective impact on the brains of listeners is altered by musical training. Our observations are consistent with the idea that music performance evokes an emotional response through a form of empathy that is based, at least in part, on the perception of movement and on violations of pulse-based temporal expectancies.},

This volume includes an extensive survey of traditional approaches to musical narrative illustrated by a wide variety of musical examples that highlight the range and applicability of the theoretical apparatus. Almén provides a careful delineation of the essential elements and preconditions of musical narrative organization, an eclectic analytical model applicable to a wide range of musical styles and repertoires, a classification scheme of narrative types and subtypes reflecting conceptually distinct narrative strategies, a wide array of interpretive categories, and a sensitivity to the dependence of narrative interpretation on the cultural milieu of the work, its various audiences, and the analyst. \textit{A Theory of Musical Narrative} provides both an excellent introduction to an increasingly important conceptual domain and a complex reassessment of its possibilities and characteristics.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-537324-0},
	shorttitle = {Composing {Electronic} {Music}},
	abstract = {Electronic music evokes new sensations, feelings, and thoughts in both composers and listeners. Opening the door to an unlimited universe of sound, it engages spatialization as an integral aspect of composition and focuses on sound transformation as a core structural strategy. In this new domain, pitch occurs as a flowing and ephemeral substance that can be bent, modulated, or dissolved into noise. Similarly, time occurs not merely as a fixed duration subdivided by ratios, but as a plastic medium that can be generated, modulated, reversed, warped, scrambled, and granulated. Envelope and waveform undulations on all time scales interweave to generate form. The power of algorithmic methods amplify the capabilities of music technology. Taken together, these constitute game-changing possibilities. This convergence of technical and aesthetic trends prompts the need for a new text focused on the opportunities of a sound oriented, multiscale approach to composition of electronic music. Sound oriented means a practice that takes place in the presence of sound. Multiscale means an approach that takes into account the perceptual and physical reality of multiple, interacting time scales-each of which can be composed. After more than a century of research and development, now is an appropriate moment to step back and reevaluate all that has changed under the ground of artistic practice.Composing Electronic Music outlines a new theory of composition based on the toolkit of electronic music techniques. The theory consists of a framework of concepts and a vocabulary of terms describing musical materials, their transformation, and their organization. Central to this discourse is the notion of narrative structure in composition-how sounds are born, interact, transform, and die. It presents a guidebook: a tour of facts, history, commentary, opinions, and pointers to interesting ideas and new possibilities to consider and explore.},

Auditory mirror neurons respond both while monkeys perform hand or mouth actions and while they listen to sounds of similar actions 1, 2. This system might be critical for auditory action understanding and language evolution 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Preliminary evidence suggests that a similar system may exist in humans 7, 8, 9, 10. Using fMRI, we searched for brain areas that respond both during motor execution and when individuals listened to the sound of an action made by the same effector. We show that a left hemispheric temporo-parieto-premotor circuit is activated in both cases, providing evidence for a human auditory mirror system. In the left premotor cortex, a somatotopic pattern of activation was also observed: A dorsal cluster was more involved during listening and execution of hand actions, and a ventral cluster was more involved during listening and execution of mouth actions. Most of this system appears to be multimodal because it also responds to the sight of similar actions. Finally, individuals who scored higher on an empathy scale activated this system more strongly, adding evidence for a possible link between the motor mirror system and empathy.},

They discretize the system with respect to time, because the aim is to run the simulation using a computer. The physics-based modelling methods can be classified as mass–spring, modal, wave digital, finite difference, digital waveguide and source–filter models. We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital filter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string. Current trends and future directions in physical modelling of musical instruments are discussed.},

	abstract = {CORDIS-ANIMA is a digital, real-time, object modeling and simulation system. The simulated objects can be seen, heard, and manipulated. This system has been built at the ACROE in several stages since 1978. It constitutes the nucleus of a creation tool for computer music (CORDIS) and animated images (ANIMA). The raison d'être of this tool is to provide reproductions of physical objects from the real world. These objects can be musical instruments (in terms of objects that produce sound vibrations when subjected to some action), or they can be visible objects such as those we observe in the real world.
The simulated copy (the simulacrum) of these objects is produced using a programmed digital device that can communicate with human operators through transducers associated with acoustic, visual, and gestural media. The gestural medium is a two- way channel; information can flow from the operator to the object (gestural action) and also from the object to the operator (tactile and kinesthetic feedback).
What we seek is total simulation. Such a simulation must restore not only the sensorimotor aspects of the object (the gestural, tactile, acoustic, and visual aspects) but also its structure and behavior. This is not merely a synthesis of the effects produced by the object but a synthesis of the intemal state of the object itself.},

	abstract = {A general CAC 1 -environment charged with physical-model-ling capabilities is described. It combines Common Music, ODE and Fluxus in a modular way, making a powerful and flexible environment for experimenting with physical models in composition. Composition in this respect refers to the generation and manipulation of structure typically on or above a note-, phrase or voice-level. Compared to efforts in synthesis and performance little work has gone into applying physical models to composition. Potentials in composition-applica-tions are presumably large. The implementation of the physically equipped CAC-en-vironment is described in detail.},

	abstract = {This paper describes TAO, a system for sound synthesis by physical modelling based on a new technique called cellular sound synthesis (CSS). The system provides a general mechanism for constructing an infinite variety of virtual instruments, and does so by providing a virtual acoustic material, elastic in nature, whose physical characteristics can be fine-tuned to produce different timbres. A wide variety of sounds such as plucked, hit, bowed and scraped sounds can be produced, all having natural physical and spacial qualities. Some of the musical and philosophical issues considered to be most important during the design and development of the system are touched upon, and the main features of the system are explained with reference to practical examples. Advantages and disadvantages of the synthesis technique and the prototype system are discussed, together with suggestions for future improvements.},
